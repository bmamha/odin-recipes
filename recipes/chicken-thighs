<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>   
<ul>
    <li>4 (8 ounce) skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
    <li>1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth</li>
    <li>4 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
    <li>1/2 cup whipping cream</li>
    <li>2 green onions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
    <li>Season chicken thighs on all sides with paprika,salt, and pepper</li>
    <li>Cook bacon in a cast iron skillet or oven-safe pan over medium-high heat until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Drain and discard excess grease from skillet</li>
    <li>Return skillet to medium heat and cook chicken thighs, skin-side down, for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip chicken over and place skillet in the preheated oven</li>

An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F(74 degrees C). remove chicken to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Remove all but 2 tablespoons drippings from skillet</li>
